# Machine-Learning-Projects
#Project 1
Analysed and Visualized 3 different datasets (Penguins, Amazon books and Diamonds Datasets)

#Project 2
The goal of this projet is to acquire experience in defining and solving a reinforcement learning (RL) environment, following OpenAI Gym standards.
The Project consists of two parts. In the first I choose the main topic for my RL environment. 
The first part focuses on defining an environment that is based on a Markov decision process. 
In the second part I applied a tabular method SARSA to solve an environment that I previously defined.

#Project 3
This project focuses on building fully connected neural networks (NN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). 
It consists of four parts where I practiced to deal with large datasets and implement, train, adjust neural networks.
The first part consists of performing data analysis (the first step for every ML project) and building a basic NN. 
In the second part, I learned how to optimize and improve the NN using various techniques. 
In the third part, I implemented a basic CNN and applied optimization and data augmentation techniques in the fourth part.
